        "Streamlit’s architecture allows you to write apps the same way you write plain Python scripts. To unlock this, Streamlit apps have a unique data flow: any time something must be updated on the screen, Streamlit just reruns your entire Python script from top to bottom.\n",
        "\n",
        "This can happen in two situations:\n",
        "\n",
        "Whenever you modify your app’s source code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Whenever a user interacts with widgets in the app. For example, when dragging a slider, entering text in an input box, or clicking a button.\n",
        "\n",
        "And to make all of this fast and seamless, Streamlit does some heavy lifting for you behind the scenes. A big player in this story is the @st.cache decorator, which allows developers to skip certain costly computations when their apps rerun. We’ll cover caching later in this page."
